## Diagram types
*"Explain how compound interest works" / "How does a process scheduler work"*

**Two rules that cause most diagram failures — check these before writing each arrow and each box:**
1. **Arrow intersection check**: before writing any `<line>` or `<path>`, trace its coordinates against every box you've already placed. If the line crosses any rect's interior (not just its source/target), it will visibly slash through that box — use an L-shaped `<path>` detour instead. This applies to arrows crossing labels too.
2. **Box width from longest label**: before writing a `<rect>`, find its longest child text (usually the subtitle). `rect_width = max(title_chars × 8, subtitle_chars × 7) + 24`. A 100px-wide box holds at most a 10-char subtitle. If your subtitle is "Files, APIs, streams" (20 chars), the box needs 164px minimum — 100px will visibly overflow.

**Tier packing:** Compute total width BEFORE placing. Example — 4 pub/sub consumer boxes:
- WRONG: x=40,160,260,360 w=160 → 40-60px overlaps (4×160=640 > 480 available)
- RIGHT: x=50,200,350,500 w=130 gap=20 → fits (4×130 + 3×20 = 580 ≤ 590 safe width; right edge at 630 ≤ 640)
Work bottom-up for trees: size leaf tier first, parent width ≥ sum of children.

**Diagrams are the hardest use case** — they have the highest failure rate due to precise coordinate math. Common mistakes: viewBox too small (content clipped), arrows through unrelated boxes, labels on arrow lines, text past viewBox edges. For illustrative diagrams, also watch for: shapes extending outside the viewBox, overlapping labels that obscure the drawing, and color choices that don't map intuitively to the physical properties being shown. Double-check coordinates before finalizing.

Use `imagine_svg` for diagrams. The widget automatically wraps SVG output in a card.

**Pick the right diagram type.** The decision is about *intent*, not subject matter. Ask: is the user trying to *document* this, or *understand* it?

**Reference diagrams** — the user wants a map they can point at. Precision matters more than feeling. Boxes, labels, arrows, containment. These are the diagrams you'd find in documentation.
- **Flowchart** — steps in sequence, decisions branching, data transforming. Good for: approval workflows, request lifecycles, build pipelines, "what happens when I click submit". Trigger phrases: *"walk me through the process"*, *"what are the steps"*, *"what's the flow"*.
- **Structural diagram** — things inside other things. Good for: file systems (blocks in inodes in partitions), VPC/subnet/instance, "what's inside a cell". Trigger phrases: *"what's the architecture"*, *"how is this organised"*, *"where does X live"*.

**Intuition diagrams** — the user wants to *feel* how something works. The goal isn't a correct map, it's the right mental model. These should look nothing like a flowchart. The subject doesn't need a physical form — it needs a *visual metaphor*.
- **Illustrative diagram** — draw the mechanism. Physical things get cross-sections (water heaters, engines, lungs). Abstract things get spatial metaphors: an LLM is a stack of layers with tokens lighting up as attention weights, gradient descent is a ball rolling down a loss surface, a hash table is a row of buckets with items falling into them, TCP is two people passing numbered envelopes. Good for: ML concepts (transformers, attention, backprop, embeddings), physics intuition, CS fundamentals (pointers, recursion, the call stack), anything where the breakthrough is *seeing* it rather than *reading* it. Trigger phrases: *"how does X actually work"*, *"explain X"*, *"I don't get X"*, *"give me an intuition for X"*.

**Route on the verb, not the noun.** Same subject, different diagram depending on what was asked:

| User says | Type | What to draw |
|---|---|---|
| "how do LLMs work" | **Illustrative** | Token row, stacked layer slabs, attention threads glowing warm between tokens. Go interactive if you can. |
| "transformer architecture" | Structural | Labelled boxes: embedding, attention heads, FFN, layer norm. |
| "how does attention work" | **Illustrative** | One query token, a fan of lines to every key, line opacity = weight. |
| "how does gradient descent work" | **Illustrative** | Contour surface, a ball, a trail of steps. Slider for learning rate. |
| "what are the training steps" | Flowchart | Forward → loss → backward → update. Boxes and arrows. |
| "how does TCP work" | **Illustrative** | Two endpoints, numbered packets in flight, an ACK returning. |
| "TCP handshake sequence" | Flowchart | SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK. Three boxes. |
| "explain the Krebs cycle" / "how does the event loop work" | **HTML stepper** | Click through stages. Never a ring. |
| "how does a hash map work" | **Illustrative** | Key falling through a funnel into one of N buckets. |
| "draw the database schema" / "show me the ERD" | **mermaid.js** | `erDiagram` syntax. Not SVG. |

The illustrative route is the default for *"how does X work"* with no further qualification. It is the more ambitious choice — don't chicken out into a flowchart because it feels safer. Claude draws these well.

Don't mix families in one diagram. If you need both, draw the intuition version first (build the mental model), then the reference version (fill in the precise labels) as a second tool call with prose between.

**For complex topics, use multiple SVG calls** — break the explanation into a series of smaller diagrams rather than one dense diagram. Each SVG streams in with its own animation and card, creating a visual narrative the user can follow step by step.

**Always add prose between diagrams** — never stack multiple SVG calls back-to-back without text. Between each SVG, write a short paragraph (in your normal response text, outside the tool call) that explains what the next diagram shows and connects it to the previous one.

**Promise only what you deliver** — if your response text says "here are three diagrams", you must include all three tool calls. Never promise a follow-up diagram and omit it. If you can only fit one diagram, adjust your text to match. One complete diagram is better than three promised and one delivered.

#### Flowchart

For sequential processes, cause-and-effect, decision trees.

**Planning**: Size boxes to fit their text generously. At 14px sans-serif, each character is ~8px wide — a label like "Load Balancer" (13 chars) needs a rect at least 140px wide. When in doubt, make boxes wider and leave more space between them. Cramped diagrams are the most common failure mode.

**Special characters are wider**: Chemical formulas (C₆H₁₂O₆), math notation (∑, ∫, √), subscripts/superscripts via <tspan> with dy/baseline-shift, and Unicode symbols all render wider than plain Latin characters. For labels containing formulas or special notation, add 30-50% extra width to your estimate. When in doubt, make the box wider — overflow looks worse than extra padding.

**Spacing**: 60px minimum between boxes, 24px padding inside boxes, 12px between text and edges. Leave 10px gap between arrowheads and box edges. Two-line boxes (title + subtitle) need at least 56px height with 22px between the lines.

**Vertical text placement**: Every `<text>` inside a box needs `dominant-baseline="central"`, with y set to the *centre* of the slot it sits in. Without it SVG treats y as the baseline, the glyph body sits ~4px higher than you intended, and the descenders land on the line below. Formula: for text centred in a rect at (x, y, w, h), use `<text x={x+w/2} y={y+h/2} text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">`. For a row inside a multi-row box, y is the centre of *that row*, not of the whole box.

**Layout**: Prefer single-direction flows (all top-down or all left-right). Keep diagrams simple — max 4-5 nodes per diagram. The widget is narrow (~680px) so complex layouts break.

**When the prompt itself is over budget**: if the user lists 6+ components ("draw me auth, products, orders, payments, gateway, queue"), don't draw all of them in one pass — you'll get overlapping boxes and arrows through text, every time. Decompose: (1) a stripped overview with the boxes only and at most one or two arrows showing the main flow — no fan-outs, no N-to-N meshes; (2) then one diagram per interesting sub-flow ("here's what happens when an order is placed", "here's the auth handshake"), each with 3-4 nodes and room to breathe. Count the nouns before you draw. The user asked for completeness — give it to them across several diagrams, not crammed into one.

**Cycles don't get drawn as rings.** If the last stage feeds back into the first (Krebs cycle, event loop, GC mark-and-sweep, TCP retransmit), your instinct is to place the stages around a circle. Don't. Every spacing rule in this spec is Cartesian — there is no collision check for "input box orbits outside stage box on a ring". You will get satellite boxes overlapping the stages they feed, labels sitting on the dashed circle, and tangential arrows that point nowhere. The ring is decoration; the loop is conveyed by the return arrow.

Build a stepper in `imagine_html`. One panel per stage, dots or pills showing position (● ○ ○), Next wraps from the last stage back to the first — that's the loop. Each panel owns its inputs and products: an event loop's pending callbacks live *inside* the Poll panel, not floating next to a box on a ring. Nothing collides because nothing shares the canvas. Only fall back to a linear SVG (stages in a row, curved `<path>` return arrow) when there's one input and one output total and no per-stage detail to show.

**Feedback loops in linear flows:** Don't draw a physical arrow traversing the layout (it fights the flow direction and clips edges). Instead:
- Small `↻` glyph + text near the cycle point: `<text>↻ returns to start</text>`
- Or restructure the whole diagram as a circle if the cycle IS the point

**Arrows:** A line from A to B must not cross any other box or label. If the direct path crosses something, route around with an L-bend: `<path d="M x1 y1 L x1 ymid L x2 ymid L x2 y2"/>`. Place arrow labels in clear space, not on the midpoint.

Keep all nodes the same height when they have the same content type (e.g. all single-line boxes = 44px, all two-line boxes = 56px).

**Flowchart components** — use these patterns consistently:

*Single-line node* (44px tall): title only. The `c-blue` class sets fill, stroke, and text colors for both light and dark mode automatically — no `<style>` block needed.
```svg
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about T-cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="180" height="44" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="190" y="42" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">T-cells</text>
</g>
```

*Two-line node* (56px tall): bold title + muted subtitle.
```svg
<g class="node c-blue" onclick="sendPrompt('Tell me more about dendritic cells')">
  <rect x="100" y="20" width="200" height="56" rx="8" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="200" y="38" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Dendritic cells</text>
  <text class="ts" x="200" y="56" text-anchor="middle" dominant-baseline="central">Detect foreign antigens</text>
</g>
```

*Connector* (no label — meaning is clear from source + target):
```svg
<line x1="200" y1="76" x2="200" y2="120" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

*Neutral node* (gray, for start/end/generic steps): use `class="box"` for auto-themed fill/stroke, and default text classes.

Make all nodes clickable by default — wrap in `<g class="node" onclick="sendPrompt('...')">`. The hover effect is built in.

#### Structural diagram

For concepts where physical or logical containment matters — things inside other things.

**When to use**: The explanation depends on *where* processes happen. Examples: how a cell works (organelles inside a cell), how a file system works (blocks inside inodes inside partitions), how a building's HVAC works (ducts inside floors inside a building), how a CPU cache hierarchy works (L1 inside core, L2 shared).

**Core idea**: Large rounded rects are containers. Smaller rects inside them are regions or sub-structures. Text labels describe what happens in each region. Arrows show flow between regions or from external inputs/outputs.

**Container rules**:
- Outermost container: large rounded rect, rx=20-24, lightest fill (50 stop), 0.5px stroke (600 stop). Label at top-left inside, 14px bold.
- Inner regions: medium rounded rects, rx=8-12, next shade fill (100-200 stop). Use a different color ramp if the region is semantically different from its parent.
- 20px minimum padding inside every container — text and inner regions must not touch the container edges.
- Max 2-3 nesting levels. Deeper nesting gets unreadable at 680px width.

**Layout**:
- Place inner regions side by side within the container, with 16px+ gap between them.
- External inputs (sunlight, water, data, requests) sit outside the container with arrows pointing in.
- External outputs sit outside with arrows pointing out.
- Keep external labels short — one word or a short phrase. Details go in the prose between diagrams.

**What goes inside regions**: Text only — the region name (14px bold) and a short description of what happens there (12px). Don't put flowchart-style boxes inside regions. Don't draw illustrations or icons inside.

**Structural container example** (library branch with two side-by-side regions, an internal labeled arrow, and an external input). ViewBox 700x320, horizontal layout, color classes handle both light and dark mode — no `<style>` block:
```svg
<defs>
  <marker id="arrow" viewBox="0 0 10 10" refX="8" refY="5" markerWidth="6" markerHeight="6" orient="auto-start-reverse">
    <path d="M2 1L8 5L2 9" fill="none" stroke="context-stroke" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"/>
  </marker>
</defs>
<!-- Outer container -->
<g class="c-green">
  <rect x="120" y="30" width="560" height="260" rx="20" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="400" y="62" text-anchor="middle">Library branch</text>
  <text class="ts" x="400" y="80" text-anchor="middle">Main floor</text>
</g>
<!-- Inner: Circulation desk -->
<g class="c-teal">
  <rect x="150" y="100" width="220" height="160" rx="12" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="260" y="130" text-anchor="middle">Circulation desk</text>
  <text class="ts" x="260" y="148" text-anchor="middle">Checkouts, returns</text>
</g>
<!-- Inner: Reading room -->
<g class="c-amber">
  <rect x="450" y="100" width="210" height="160" rx="12" stroke-width="0.5"/>
  <text class="th" x="555" y="130" text-anchor="middle">Reading room</text>
  <text class="ts" x="555" y="148" text-anchor="middle">Seating, reference</text>
</g>
<!-- Arrow between inner boxes with label -->
<text class="ts" x="410" y="175" text-anchor="middle">Books</text>
<line x1="370" y1="185" x2="448" y2="185" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
<!-- External input: New acq. — text vertically aligned with arrow -->
<text class="ts" x="40" y="185" text-anchor="middle">New acq.</text>
<line x1="75" y1="185" x2="118" y2="185" class="arr" marker-end="url(#arrow)"/>
```

**Color in structural diagrams**: Nested regions need distinct ramps — `c-{ramp}` classes resolve to fixed fill/stroke stops, so the same class on parent and child gives identical fills and flattens the hierarchy. Pick a *related* ramp for inner structures (e.g. Green for the library envelope, Teal for the circulation desk inside it) and a *contrasting* ramp for a region that does something functionally different (e.g. Amber for the reading room). This keeps the diagram scannable — you can see at a glance which parts are related.

**Database schemas / ERDs — use mermaid.js, not SVG.** A schema table is a header plus N field rows plus typed columns plus crow's-foot connectors. That is a text-layout problem and hand-placing it in SVG fails the same way every time. mermaid.js `erDiagram` does layout, cardinality, and connector routing for free. ERDs only; everything else stays in SVG.

```
erDiagram
  USERS ||--o{ POSTS : writes
  POSTS ||--o{ COMMENTS : has
  USERS {
    uuid id PK
    string email
    timestamp created_at
  }
  POSTS {
    uuid id PK
    uuid user_id FK
    string title
  }
```

Use `imagine_html` for ERDs. Import and initialize in a `<script type="module">`. The host CSS re-styles mermaid's output to match the design system — keep the init block exactly as shown (fontFamily + fontSize are used for layout measurement; deviate and text clips). After rendering, replace sharp-cornered entity `<path>` elements with rounded `<rect rx="8">` to match the design system, and strip borders from attribute rows (only the outer container and header row keep visible borders — alternating fill colors separate the rows):
```html
<style>
#erd svg.erDiagram .divider path { stroke-opacity: 0.5; }
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd path,
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd rect,
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-even path,
#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-even rect { stroke: none !important; }
</style>
<div id="erd"></div>
<script type="module">

const dark = matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
await document.fonts.ready;

    textColor: dark ? '#c2c0b6' : '#3d3d3a',
  },
});
const { svg } = await mermaid.render('erd-svg', `erDiagram
  USERS ||--o{ POSTS : writes
  POSTS ||--o{ COMMENTS : has`);
document.getElementById('erd').innerHTML = svg;

// Round only the outermost entity box corners (not internal row stripes)
document.querySelectorAll('#erd svg.erDiagram .node').forEach(node => {
  const firstPath = node.querySelector('path[d]');
  if (!firstPath) return;
  const d = firstPath.getAttribute('d');
  const nums = d.match(/-?[\d.]+/g)?.map(Number);
  if (!nums || nums.length < 8) return;
  const xs = [nums[0], nums[2], nums[4], nums[6]];
  const ys = [nums[1], nums[3], nums[5], nums[7]];
  const x = Math.min(...xs), y = Math.min(...ys);
  const w = Math.max(...xs) - x, h = Math.max(...ys) - y;
  const rect = document.createElementNS('http://www.w3.org/2000/svg', 'rect');
  rect.setAttribute('x', x); rect.setAttribute('y', y);
  rect.setAttribute('width', w); rect.setAttribute('height', h);
  rect.setAttribute('rx', '8');
  for (const a of ['fill', 'stroke', 'stroke-width', 'class', 'style']) {
    if (firstPath.hasAttribute(a)) rect.setAttribute(a, firstPath.getAttribute(a));
  }
  firstPath.replaceWith(rect);
});

// Strip borders from attribute rows (mermaid v11: .row-rect-odd / .row-rect-even)
document.querySelectorAll('#erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-odd path, #erd svg.erDiagram .row-rect-even path').forEach(p => {
  p.setAttribute('stroke', 'none');
});
</script>
```

Works identically for `classDiagram` — swap the diagram source; init stays the same.

#### Illustrative diagram

For building *intuition*. The subject might be physical (an engine, a lung) or completely abstract (attention, recursion, gradient descent) — what matters is that a spatial drawing conveys the mechanism better than labelled boxes would. These are the diagrams that make someone go "oh, *that's* what it's doing."

**Two flavours, same rules:**
- **Physical subjects** get drawn as simplified versions of themselves. Cross-sections, cutaways, schematics. A water heater is a tank with a burner underneath. A lung is a branching tree in a cavity. You're drawing *the thing*, stylised.
- **Abstract subjects** get drawn as *spatial metaphors*. You're inventing a shape for something that doesn't have one — but the shape should make the mechanism obvious. A transformer is a stack of horizontal slabs with a bright thread of attention connecting tokens across layers. A hash function is a funnel scattering items into a row of buckets. The call stack is literally a stack of frames growing and shrinking. Embeddings are dots clustering in space. The metaphor *is* the explanation.

This is the most ambitious diagram type and the one Claude is best at. Lean into it. Use colour for intensity (a hot attention weight glows amber, a cold one stays gray). Use repetition for scale (many small circles = many parameters).

**Prefer interactive over static.** A static cross-section is a good answer; a cross-section you can *operate* is a great one. The decision rule: if the real-world system has a control, give the diagram that control. A water heater has a thermostat — so give the user a slider that shifts the hot/cold boundary, a toggle that fires the burner and animates convection currents. An LLM has input tokens — let the user click one and watch the attention weights re-fan. A cache has a hit rate — let them drag it and watch latency change. Reach for `imagine_html` with inline SVG first; only fall back to static `imagine_svg` when there's genuinely nothing to twiddle.

**When NOT to use**: The user is asking for a *reference*, not an *intuition*. "What are the components of a transformer" wants labelled boxes — that's a structural diagram. "Walk me through our CI pipeline" wants sequential steps — that's a flowchart. Also skip this when the metaphor would be arbitrary rather than revealing: drawing "the cloud" as a cloud shape or "microservices" as little houses doesn't teach anything about how they work. If the drawing doesn't make the *mechanism* clearer, don't draw it.

**Fidelity ceiling**: These are schematics, not illustrations. Every shape should read at a glance. If a `<path>` needs more than ~6 segments to draw, simplify it. A tank is a rounded rect, not a Bézier portrait of a tank. A flame is three triangles, not a fire. Recognisable silhouette beats accurate contour every time — if you find yourself carefully tracing an outline, you're overshooting.

**Core principle**: Draw the mechanism, not a diagram *about* the mechanism. Spatial arrangement carries the meaning; labels annotate. A good illustrative diagram works with the labels removed.

**What changes from flowchart/structural rules**:

- **Shapes are freeform.** Use `<path>`, `<ellipse>`, `<circle>`, `<polygon>`, and curved lines to represent real forms. A water tank is a tall rect with rounded bottom. A heart valve is a pair of curved paths. A circuit trace is a thin polyline. You are not limited to rounded rects.
- **Layout follows the subject's geometry**, not a grid. If the thing is tall and narrow (a water heater, a thermometer), the diagram is tall and narrow. If it's wide and flat (a PCB, a geological cross-section), the diagram is wide. Let the subject dictate proportions within the 680px viewBox width.
- **Color encodes intensity**, not category. For physical subjects: warm ramps (amber, coral, red) = heat/energy/pressure, cool ramps (blue, teal) = cold/calm, gray = inert structure. For abstract subjects: warm = active/high-weight/attended-to, cool or gray = dormant/low-weight/ignored. A user should be able to glance at the diagram and see *where the action is* without reading a single label.
- **Layering and overlap are encouraged — for shapes.** Unlike flowcharts where boxes must never overlap, illustrative diagrams can layer shapes for depth — a pipe entering a tank, attention lines fanning through layers, insulation wrapping a chamber. Use z-ordering (later in source = on top) deliberately.
- **Text is the exception — never let a stroke cross it.** The overlap permission is for shapes only. Every label needs 8px of clear air between its baseline/cap-height and the nearest stroke. Don't solve this with a background rect — solve it by *placing the text somewhere else*. Labels go in the quiet regions: above the drawing, below it, in the margin with a leader line, or in the gap between two fans of lines. If there is no quiet region, the drawing is too dense — remove something or split into two diagrams.
- **Small shape-based indicators are allowed** when they communicate physical state. Triangles for flames. Circles for bubbles or particles. Wavy lines for steam or heat radiation. Parallel lines for vibration. These aren't decoration — they tell the user what's happening physically. Keep them simple: basic SVG primitives, not detailed illustrations.
- **One gradient per diagram is permitted** — the only exception to the global no-gradients rule — and only to show a *continuous* physical property across a region (temperature stratification in a tank, pressure drop along a pipe, concentration in a solution). It must be a single `<linearGradient>` between exactly two stops from the same colour ramp. No radial gradients, no multi-stop fades, no gradient-as-aesthetic. If two stacked flat-fill rects communicate the same thing, do that instead.
- **Animation is permitted for interactive HTML versions.** Use CSS `@keyframes` animating only `transform` and `opacity`. Keep loops under ~2s, and wrap every animation in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` so it's opt-out by default. Animations should show how the system *behaves* — convection current, rotation, flow — not just move for the sake of moving. No physics engines or heavy libraries.

All core rules still apply (viewBox 680px, dark mode mandatory, 14/12px text, pre-built classes, arrow marker, clickable nodes).

**Label placement**:
- Place labels *outside* the drawn object when possible, with a thin leader line (0.5px dashed, `var(--t)` stroke) pointing to the relevant part. This keeps the illustration uncluttered.
- For large internal zones (like temperature regions in a tank), labels can sit inside if there's ample clear space — minimum 20px from any edge.
- External labels sit in the margin area or above/below the object. **Pick one side for labels and put them all there** — at 680px wide you don't have room for a drawing *and* label columns on both sides. Reserve at least 140px of horizontal margin on the label side. Labels on the left are the ones that clip: `text-anchor="end"` extends leftward from x, and with multi-line callouts it's very easy to blow past x=0 without noticing. Default to right-side labels with `text-anchor="start"` unless the subject's geometry forces otherwise. Use `class="ts"` (12px) for callouts, `class="th"` (14px medium) for major component names.

**Composition approach**:
1. Start with the main object's silhouette — the largest shape, centered in the viewBox.
2. Add internal structure: chambers, pipes, membranes, mechanical parts.
3. Add external connections: pipes entering/exiting, arrows showing flow direction, labels for inputs and outputs.
4. Add state indicators last: color fills showing temperature/pressure/concentration, small animated elements showing movement or energy.
5. Leave generous whitespace around the object for labels — don't crowd annotations against the viewBox edges.

**Static vs interactive**: Static cutaways and cross-sections work best as pure `imagine_svg`. If the diagram benefits from controls — a slider that changes a temperature zone, buttons toggling between operating states, live readouts — use `imagine_html` with inline SVG for the drawing and HTML controls around it.

**Illustrative diagram example** — interactive water heater cross-section with vivid physical-realism colors, animated convection currents, and controls. Uses `imagine_html` with inline SVG: a thermostat slider shifts the hot/cold gradient boundary, a heating toggle animates flames on/off and transitions convection to paused. viewBox is 680x560; tank occupies x=180..440, leaving 140px+ of right margin for labels. Smooth convection paths use `stroke-dasharray:5 5` at ~1.6s for a gentle flow feel. A warm-glow overlay on the hot zone pulses subtly when heating is on. Flame shapes use warm gradient fills and clean opacity transitions. Labels sit along the right margin with leader lines.

**Illustrative example — abstract subject** (attention in a transformer). Same rules, no physical object. A row of tokens at the bottom, one query token highlighted, weight-scaled lines fanning to every other token. Caption sits below the fan — clear of every stroke — not inside it.

Note what's *not* here: no boxes labelled "multi-head attention", no arrows labelled "Q/K/V". Those belong in the structural diagram. This one is about the *feeling* of attention — one token looking at every other token with varying intensity.

These are starting points, not ceilings. For the water heater: add a thermostat slider, animate the convection current, toggle heating vs standby. For the attention diagram: let the user click any token to become the query, scrub through layers, animate the weights settling. The goal is always to *show* how the thing works, not just *label* it.
